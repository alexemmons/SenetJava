:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::THE RULES OF SENET:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Senet is a 2 player game.

Each player has 7 pawns.

The objective of the game is to move all of one's pawns off the board before the other player can.

Pawns move across the board in a backwards S direction.

The amount of squares a pawn can move are determined by the throwing of 4 sticks.
Each turn, a player throws the sticks by clicking the bottom section of the game screen.

Each brown stick counts as a movement across 1 square. If 4 brown sticks are thrown, then the player may advance his stone 5 spaces.

If a move will result in a player's stone landing on a square occupied with another one of his stones, no movement will occur, and his turn will end.

If a move will result in a player's stone landing on a square occupied with one of the other player's stones, the 2 stones will swap places.

The square in the center row is the House of Rebirth.

On the bottom row of the board are 4 special squares.

From left to right, they are:

The House of Happiness:

Stones rolling past this square must land on this square.

The House of Water:

A stone landing here will arrive back at the House of Rebirth.

The House of Three Truths:

A stone may only leave this square when a 3 is rolled.

The House of Ra-Atoum:

A stone may only leave this square when a 2 is rolled.

Enjoy Senet!
